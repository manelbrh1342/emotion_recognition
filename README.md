<b>Open-source deep learning for robust emotion recognition from raw audio.</b>

## ðŸš€ Overview

This project explores **emotion recognition from speech** using modern deep learning, including **Wav2Vec2** and classic sequence models. The system listens to short audio clips (4â€“8 seconds) and predicts the speakerâ€™s emotional state among 8 classes.

**Final model accuracy: ~95%** (multi-corpus, Wav2Vec2, 4s input)

---

## Features

- Emotion classification into 8 classes: Angry, Calm, Disgust, Fearful, Happy, Neutral, Sad, Surprised
- Achieves up to **94.96% accuracy** (4s inputs, multi-dataset)
- Full-stack demo: React frontend + Hugging Face backend API
- Transparent, open-sourced training journey (from 12% â†’ 95%)
- Reproducible experiments, robust feature extraction, and class balancing

## Training Journey

This project evolved through multiple stages, each milestone improving on the last:

- **v1 (FFNN, MFCC):** ~12% accuracy (no sequence modeling)
- **v2 (LSTM, MFCC):** ~33% accuracy (temporal modeling)
- **v3 (LSTM, log-mel):** ~50% accuracy (better features, dropout)
- **v4 (CRNN, SpecAugment):** ~69% accuracy (CNN+BiLSTM, augmentation)
- **v5 (Wav2Vec2, RAVDESS):** ~85% accuracy (pretrained transformer)
- **v6 (Wav2Vec2, multi-dataset):** ~95% accuracy (multi-corpus, robust)

See [`model/milestones/`](model/milestones/) for the code and results of each stage.
